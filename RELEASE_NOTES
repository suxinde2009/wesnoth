This file is here to allow devs to easily add stuff in the release notes for the next release, it allows easy syncing with the release team, since you don't have to be around when the release takes place...

Just dump whatever you want to have mentioned in the release notes here. Please take care that it is in a way that allows copy&paste to the release notes. That is making sure that spelling/grammar/whatever is usable and that you are using complete sentences, not just single words. Please do use forum syntax and do *NOT* split lines after 80 chars!

Stuff that belongs in here:
* groundbreaking changes (new campaigns, extremely new feature, ...)
* changed dependencies (new things, version bumps, stuff that was removed)
* known bugs

The release team should empty this file after each release.

[rasection="Support for SDL 1.2 has been dropped"]
SDL version 1.2.x has been removed in favour of SDL version 2.0.x. The build systems have been and all code has been removed that utilised verions 1.2.x.

[rasection="WML/Lua compatibility changes and deprecations"]

[rasection="Wesnoth Formula Language update"]
The Wesnoth formula language used by $(...) substitution, the formula= key in standard unit filters, and a few other places has received some significant updates. The changlog has the full list, but some highlights are:
[list]
[*]New operators for string concatenation, ranges, and testing containment
[*]New string interpolation syntax
[*]Dot operator can access identifier-friendly string keys in maps
[*]Function definitions work outside FormulaAI and GUI2
[*]Many new functions for math and string manipulation
[*]Exponentiation operator is now right-associative (meaning 2^3^2 now produces 512 rather than 64)
[*]Dice operator is now synced
[*]Improved formula debugger
[/list]
The "fai" and "faiend" keywords are deprecated in favour of "wfl" and "wflend" respectively. This is part of a move to more clearly distinguish [wiki]Wesnoth Formula Language[/wiki], the language itself, from [wiki]FormulaAI[/wiki], which is just one use of the language in Wesnoth.

The attributes leader, total_movement, movement_left, and states in WFL unit variables were renamed to canrecruit, max_moves, moves, and status respectively; this was done to make them match the Lua and WML names for the same things. Also, the special attribute in WFL weapon variables is now specials. The old names will continue to work for now, but they may be removed in a future version.
[/rasection]

[rasection="Changes to the AI"]
After several development cycles of adding new and/or experimental features to the AI engine, a long overdue AI code cleanup effort was undertaken in order to facilitate future AI maintenance and development. This included a refactoring and reorganization of the code of the current AI as well as the removal of non-functional, outdated or deprecated code.

As a result, the format for configuring some AI parameters has been simplified. The AI functionality has also been extended in several ways. For example, it now allows Lua facets and the [modify_ai] tag has been extended to allow editing the internal jobs of the recruitment_instructions aspect.

While making these changes, we tried to retain backward compatibility as much as feasible. Thus, most of the changes are invisible to the WML and custom AI developer and the vast majority of existing UMC code will continue to function as is. It is, however, unavoidable that some old AIs or AI configurations will require updating. A summary of those changes is given below. For more details, see the full changelog and the Wesnoth wiki. In addition, we have set up a separate [forum thread; create first post and add link] in which you can post any questions and problems you might encounter while updating your code.
[/rasection]

[rawarn="AI compatibility breaking changes"]
Several old, deprecated AI components were removed:
[list]
[*]Several aspects that no longer did anything anyway: number_of_possible_recruits_to_force_recruit, recruitment_ignore_bad_combat, recruitment_ignore_bad_movement
[*]The recruitment aspect; however, this is automatically translated to a recruitment_instructions aspect, which means it will now be honored where it was previously ignored
[*]Stages that were either old and deprecated or experimental and unmaintained/broken: old recruitment, fallback, Strategy Formulation with RCA
[*]Candidate actions that were either old and deprecated or experimental and unmaintained/broken: old recruitment, simple move-to-targets, global fallback, Akihara recruitment, experimental recruitment
[*]The protect_my_unit [goal] type
[/list]

A number of changes were made to the way Lua AI components are declared in the WML and how the code is called by the engine. The wiki documents the new method in detail, but unfortunately these changes are likely to break some AIs. However, the fixes will be simple in most cases:
[list=1]
[*]If you used old-style Lua candidate actions (with execute= and evaluate= keys) together with an explicit [engine]name=lua tag, they will no longer work as written. In many cases, the fix will be simple - the code within [engine] frequently begins with a line similar to [c]local ai = ...[/c]. Simply removing this line will be sufficient to fix most such cases; if you accessed a "data" variable in the AI, see the Experimental AI definition (data/ai/ais/ai_generic_rush.cfg) for an example of how to fix it.
[*]If you used old-style Lua candidate actions without an explicit engine tag, you may need to remove a line similar to [c]local ai = ...[/c] from some of your code. In general, anything of the form [c]ai = <something>[/c] needs to be changed.
[*]If you used new-style (external) Lua candidate actions (with a location key), they will still work for the time being (provided that they use the exec_parms= and/or eval_parms= keys), but we recommend updating them nevertheless. The exec_parms= and eval_parms= keys should be combined into an [args] tag, and the argument list of your execution and evaluation functions should be changed from [c](ai, cfg, self)[/c] to [c](cfg, data)[/c]. The data parameter is the same as self.data was before; however, provided you do not have an explicit [engine] tag, self.data will continue to work.

KNOWN BUGS
==========

[raissue="Newly introduced in 1.13.x"]
[b]General bugs:[/b]

[list]
[*]The MP server has trouble with Local player types in campaigns (bug [bug]21965[/bug]). We have decided to postpone dealing with this. In the meantime, you might try assigning such sides to the host, or running multiple instances of Wesnoth.
[*]Wesnoth does not exist on the panel (bug [bug]24202[/bug]).
[*]"Name of Game" bleeds onto "Player/Type" label when leaving/entering the app (bug [bug]24437[/bug]).
[*]Inconsistent transparency on credits screen (bug [bug]24428[/bug]).
[*]options become black on hover (bug [bug]24478[/bug]).
[*]Dialog In Replay Clearing Issue (bug [bug]24491[/bug]).
[/list]
[/raissue]

[raissue="Carried over from 1.12.x"]
[b]General bugs:[/b]

[list]
[*]The game can crash when planning recruits in Planning Mode.
[/list]

[b]Bugs specific to Microsoft Windows:[/b]

[list]
[*]ClearType font rendering is disabled as it causes glitches (bug [bug]21648[/bug]).
This is likely caused by outdated libraries in the packaging process.
[*]Consecutive line breaks (paragraph breaks) are not rendered as expected (bug [bug]21649[/bug]).
This is likely caused by outdated libraries in the packaging process. There is no built-in workaround available yet.
[/list]

[b]Bugs specific to Apple OS X:[/b]

The following issues affecting Wesnoth on Apple OS X are known and they are pending fixes. Many of them require significant re-engineering that can only be done in 1.13.x development releases later, or cannot be properly addressed due to a lack of experienced OS X coders in our team. Thus, unless someone can contribute patches to address them, it is unlikely that these bugs will be fixed.

[list]
[*]The default variable-width font is used instead of a monospace font even where a monospace font is required (bug [bug]23628[/bug]).
[*]Helvetica is used as the default variable-width font instead of DejaVu Sans (bug [bug]23560[/bug]).
[*]Fullscreen mode does not fill the entire screen when maximum resolution is selected in Preferences â†’ Display, and user interface elements are scaled and distorted.
[*]System commands do not work while Wesnoth is running in fullscreen mode (bug [bug]21943[/bug]).
[*]Trackpad tap clicking is sometimes not recognized ([url=http://forums.wesnoth.org/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=39788]forum post[/url]).
[*]Unofficial builds  with OpenMP support enabled randomly freeze (bug [bug]18144[/bug]).
[*]Consecutive line breaks (paragraph breaks) are not rendered as expected (bug [bug]21649[/bug]).
This is likely caused by outdated libraries in the packaging process. There is no built-in workaround available yet.
